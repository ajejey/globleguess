Multiplayer Game Architecture with LocalStorage Synchronization
Overview
The Game should implement a robust multiplayer architecture that uses LocalStorage as the source of truth while avoiding race conditions. This approach allows you to build multiplayer applications without relying on a database, making it ideal for lightweight, real-time games.

Core Architecture Components
1. State Management Strategy
Server-Side State
In-Memory Game State: The server maintains an in-memory representation of all active games in the activeGames object.
Game Model: Each game instance encapsulates its own state, including players, rounds, settings, and game progress.
Source of Truth: While the server maintains the active state, LocalStorage is treated as the authoritative source of truth for game restoration.
Client-Side State
React Context: The frontend uses a GameContext to manage and distribute game state across components.
LocalStorage Persistence: All game state is saved to LocalStorage, enabling seamless reconnection.
Redundant Storage: Every player stores the complete game state, creating multiple backups.
2. Synchronization Mechanism
State Synchronization Flow
Server-to-Client: The server broadcasts state updates to all connected clients via Socket.IO events.
Client-to-LocalStorage: Each client saves the complete game state to LocalStorage whenever it changes.
LocalStorage-to-Server: When players reconnect, they send their saved state to the server for restoration.
Preventing Race Conditions
Single Source of Truth: For active games, the server is the authoritative source.
Event-Based Updates: All state changes flow through the server, which broadcasts the new state to all clients.
Atomic Operations: Game actions (guesses, round transitions) are processed sequentially by the server.
Player ID Tracking: Each player has a unique socket ID that prevents conflicting actions.
3. Reconnection Strategy
The system handles reconnections through a multi-layered approach:

Session Tracking: Basic player session info is stored in LocalStorage under emojiGameSession.
Complete State Backup: Full game state is stored under emojiGame_[gameId].
Reconnection Flow:
When a player reconnects, they send their saved game state to the server.
The server restores the game using this state if the game is no longer active in memory.
The player rejoins the game with their original name and role (host/player).
Disconnection Handling:
Disconnected players are tracked in the disconnectedPlayers object.
Players can reconnect within a 5-minute window.
Host privileges are preserved and restored upon reconnection.
Implementation Details
Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO)
javascript
CopyInsert
// Key components in the backend
const activeGames = {};  // In-memory store of active games

// Socket handler for reconnection
socket.on('rejoin_game', ({ gameId, playerName, previousPlayerId, savedGameState }, callback) => {
  let game = activeGames[gameId];
  
  // If game not found but we have saved state from localStorage, restore it
  if (!game && savedGameState) {
    game = new Game(savedGameState.hostId, {
      ...savedGameState.settings,
      id: savedGameState.id,
      rounds: savedGameState.rounds || []
    });
    
    // Restore other game state properties
    Object.assign(game, {
      ...savedGameState,
      players: {}, // Reset players since they'll rejoin
      disconnectedPlayers: {} // Reset disconnected players
    });
    
    activeGames[gameId] = game;
  }
  
  // Handle player reconnection...
});
Frontend (React + Socket.IO Client)
javascript
CopyInsert
// Key components in the frontend
const saveGameState = (state) => {
  if (state && state.id) {
    localStorage.setItem(`emojiGame_${state.id}`, JSON.stringify({
      gameState: state,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }));
  }
};

// Reconnection logic
socketInstance.on('connect', async () => {
  const savedSession = localStorage.getItem('emojiGameSession');
  if (savedSession) {
    const session = JSON.parse(savedSession);
    
    // Get the saved game state from localStorage
    let savedGameState = null;
    const savedData = localStorage.getItem(`emojiGame_${session.gameId}`);
    if (savedData) {
      savedGameState = JSON.parse(savedData).gameState;
    }
    
    // Attempt to rejoin with the saved state
    socketInstance.emit('rejoin_game', {
      gameId: session.gameId,
      playerName: session.playerName,
      previousPlayerId: session.playerId,
      savedGameState
    }, (response) => {
      // Handle response...
    });
  }
});
Best Practices for New Multiplayer Games
1. State Management
Redundant Storage: Have every client store the complete game state.
Timestamp Everything: Add timestamps to all state changes for conflict resolution.
Clear Ownership: Define who "owns" each piece of state (usually the server).
2. Synchronization
Event-Driven Architecture: Use Socket.IO events for all state changes.
Atomic Operations: Process one game action at a time on the server.
Broadcast Updates: Send the new state to all clients after each change.
Validation: Always validate actions on the server before applying them.
3. Reconnection
Session Persistence: Store enough information to identify returning players.
State Restoration: Allow any player to provide the game state for restoration.
Role Preservation: Maintain special roles (like host) across reconnections.
Time Windows: Define reasonable time windows for reconnection (e.g., 5 minutes).
