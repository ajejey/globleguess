            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
              Beyond just fond memories, many classic game mechanics are inherently enjoyable and timeless. The simple satisfaction of a well-timed jump, the thrill of discovering a secret passage, or the addictive nature of a straightforward scoring system – these elements were perfected decades ago and still resonate today. Often, the constraints of older hardware led to incredibly tight and focused game design, resulting in experiences that are easy to pick up but hard to master.
