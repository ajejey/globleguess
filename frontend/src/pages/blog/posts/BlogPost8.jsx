      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-5">The Challenge of Traditional Geography Learning</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Let's face it, for many, traditional geography lessons brought to mind endless lists of countries, capitals, and static maps.
        While factual knowledge is important, this approach can sometimes strip away the inherent wonder of exploring our diverse world, making geography feel more like a memory test than a journey of discovery.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-5">Globle Guess Game: A Fresh, Interactive Approach</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Globle Guess Game takes a dramatically different route, leveraging the power of interactivity and visual feedback:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 pl-4 space-y-3">
        <li className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">The Interactive 3D Globe:</strong> Our centerpiece is a dynamic 3D globe that brings the Earth to your fingertips. Countries aren't just flat shapes on a page; they are parts of a vibrant, rotating sphere, offering a realistic perspective of global relationships.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Guessing as Active Learning:</strong> The core mechanic—guessing a country and receiving color-coded proximity feedback—is a powerful active learning loop. Each guess isn't a pass or fail, but a clue that hones your spatial awareness and geographical knowledge.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Visual Feedback & Discovery:</strong> Seeing your guessed country light up on the globe, and understanding its distance from the target through intuitive color gradients, provides immediate, impactful learning. This visual connection is far more memorable than text alone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-5">More Than Just Identifying Countries</h2>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        While the primary goal is to find the target country, the educational benefits of Globle Guess Game extend further:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 pl-4 space-y-3">
        <li className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Implicit Regional Learning:</strong> As you guess, you naturally start to learn about regions, continents, and the relative locations of countries you might not have focused on before.
        </li>
        <li className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          <strong className="font-semibold text-gray-900">Sparking Curiosity:</strong> Guessing a country you've never heard of, or one that's surprisingly far (or close!), often sparks a desire to learn more about its culture, history, and people. Globle Guess can be a fantastic launchpad for further exploration.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-10 mb-5">Fun and Engaging for All Ages & Skill Levels</h2>
